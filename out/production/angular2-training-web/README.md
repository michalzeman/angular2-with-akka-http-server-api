### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3**

```bash
# go to
cd angular2-training-web

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# start the server
npm start

# use Hot Module Replacement
npm run server:dev:hmr
```
go to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser


## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular2-trating-web/
 ├──config/                    * our configuration
 |   ├──helpers.js             * helper functions for our configuration files
 |   ├──spec-bundle.js         * ignore this magic that sets up our angular 2 testing environment
 |   ├──karma.conf.js          * karma config for our unit tests
 |   ├──protractor.conf.js     * protractor config for our end-to-end tests

 │   ├──webpack.prod.js        * our production webpack config
 │   └──webpack.test.js        * our testing webpack config

 |   ├──vendor.ts              * our vendor file

 │   │   ├──app.e2e.ts         * a simple end-to-end test for /
 │   │   └──app.ts             * App.ts: a simple version of our App component components

 ├──package.json               * what npm uses to manage it's dependencies
 └──webpack.config.js          * webpack main configuration file

```

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.x.x`+ (or `v5.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install webpack-dev-server rimraf webpack -g` to install required global dependencies
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod
```

### hot module replacement
```bash
npm run server:dev:hmr
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### watch and run our tests
```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have your server running in another terminal
npm run e2e
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:update
npm run webdriver:start
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:start
# in another terminal
npm run e2e:live
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

# Frequently asked questions
* What's the current browser support for Angular 2 Beta?
  * Please view the updated list of [browser support for Angular 2](https://github.com/angularclass/awesome-angular2#current-browser-support-for-angular-2)
* Why is my service, aka provider, is not injecting parameter correctly?
  * Please use `@Injectable()` for your service for typescript to correctly attach the metadata (this is a TypeScript problem)
* How do I run protractor with node 0.12.x?
  * please check out this repo to use the old version of protractor [#146](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/146/files)
* Where do I write my tests?
  * You can write your tests next to your component files. See [`/src/app/home/home.spec.ts`](/src/app/home/home.spec.ts)
* How do I start the app when I get `EACCES` and `EADDRINUSE` errors?
  * The `EADDRINUSE` error means the port `3000` is currently being used and `EACCES` is lack of permission for webpack to build files to `./dist/`
* How to use `sass` for css?
 * `loaders: ['raw-loader','sass-loader']` and `@Component({ styles: [ require('./filename.scss') ] })` see issue [#136](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/136)
* How do I test a Service?
 * See issue [#130](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/130#issuecomment-158872648)
* How do I add `vscode-chrome-debug` support?
 * The VS Code chrome debug extension support can be done via `launch.json` see issue [#144](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/144#issuecomment-164063790)
* How do I make the repo work in a virtual machine?
 * You need to use `0.0.0.0` so revert these changes [#205](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/205/files)
* What are the naming conventions for Angular 2?
 * please see issue [#185](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/185) and PR [196](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/196)
* How do I include bootstrap or jQuery?
 * please see issue [#215](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/215) and [#214](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/214#event-511768416)
* How do I async load a component?
 * see wiki [How-do-I-async-load-a-component-with-AsyncRoute](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-do-I-async-load-a-component-with-AsyncRoute)
* Error: Cannot find module 'tapable'
 * Remove `node_modules/` and run `npm cache clean` then `npm install`
* What about Webpack 2?
 * If you're looking for Webpack 2 version then see the [experimental version](https://github.com/gdi2290/angular2-webpack2-starter) that will be merged soon.
* How do I turn on Hot Module Replacement
 * Run `npm run server:dev:hmr`
* `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`
 * This is a problem with minifying Angular 2 and it's recent JIT templates. If you set `mangle` to `false` then you should be good.
* Why is the size of my app larger in development?
 * We are using inline source-maps and hot module replacement which will increase the bundle size.
* If you're in China
 * check out https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm
* If you're looking to add Angular 2 Material Design
 * check out the [material2](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/material2) branch
